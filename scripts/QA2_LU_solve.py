The Adaptive Bridge Safety System

Your coastal city now uses a smart sensor grid to monitor multiple bridges 
with varying numbers of support joints. Each bridge's stability is governed by Ax = b, 
where A is an n*n force distribution matrix and b is the dynamic load vector. 
Sensors sometimes scramble equation orders (hint: organization matters) and safety 
thresholds vary by bridge age. 

Write a program to:
Factorize A accounting for potential sensor errors
Solve for force vector x

Input:
The first line contains an integer n, the size of the matrix A (number of joints).
The next n lines contain n space-separated floating-point numbers, representing the rows of matrix A.
The last line contains n space-separated floating-point numbers, representing the vector b.

Output:
Print the P matrix, rounded to 2 decimal places.
Print the L matrix, rounded to 2 decimal places.
Print the U matrix, rounded to 2 decimal places.
Print the solution vector x, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Note: You should only write your logic in decompose_and_solve method and return the required answers. 
Proper printing format will be taken care of by the boilerplate. 

DO NOT CHANGE THE BOILERPLATE.

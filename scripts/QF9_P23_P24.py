Conceptual Question:

Title: Kernel and Range of a Linear Transformation

Description:
In linear algebra, the kernel (or null space) of a linear transformation 
T is the set of all vectors that map to the zero vector, and the range (or image) is the set of all vectors that can be expressed as T(v) for some input vector v. Your task is to determine the kernel and range of a given linear transformation represented by a 2x2 matrix A.

Input:
-- 2x2 matrix A
   For example, A = [1 2
		             2 4]


-- The input will consist of two lines, each containing two space-separated integers or floating-point numbers representing the rows of the matrix.

Output:
-- Basis for the kernel of A.
-- Basis for the range of A.

The output will consist of:

-- The basis for the kernel (if any), printed as space-separated values.

-- The basis for the range, printed as space-separated values, with each basis vector on a new line.

Test Cases 1:

Input:
1 2
2 4

Output:
-2.0 1
1.0 2.0


Test Case 2:
Input:
1 1
1 1

Output:
-1.0 1.0
1.0 1.0

Test Case 3:
Input:
1 0
0 1

Output:
1.0 0.0
0.0 1.0
